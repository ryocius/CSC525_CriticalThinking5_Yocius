Everyone who speaks, evil against the name of N., 138a. when he ascends, Geb reckons him as an evil-doer in his own city, 138b. so that he weakens, he falters. Thou purifiest thyself in the dew of the stars 138c. thou descendest on firm copper cables, on the shoulders of Horus in his name of He who is in the Ḥnw-boat. 139a.
