Go after pursue thy sun days purify thyself, 137b. for thy bones are those of female-falcons, goddesses, who are in heaven, 137c. that thou mayest be at the side of the god that thou mayest leave thy house to thy son 137d. who is thine heir. Everyone who speaks, evil against the name of N., 138a. when he ascends, Geb reckons him as an evil-doer in his own city, 138b. so that he weakens, he falters. Thou purifiest thyself in the dew of the stars 138c. thou descendest on firm copper cables, on the shoulders of Horus in his name of He who is in the Ḥnw-boat. 139a.

Mayest thou catch the testicles of Set mayest thou drive away his mutilation. 142c. That one was born to thee this one was conceived by thee. 143a.
